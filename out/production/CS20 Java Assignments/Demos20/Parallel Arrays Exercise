Part A)
Code a parallel array where using the index position of a piece
of information will allow you access to the matching information.
For example, one list may be your student ID number and the matching
lists may be your final GPA for the year. Make up a sample class
size of 10 students.

Part B)
I will enter an ID number and it should print out the corresponding
GPA, or indicate that the ID does not exist.

Suggestions:
Select what data youâ€™d like to represent in your parallel data
structures

Print out your data to ensure that you have entered it correctly.
After it works, comment this out.

For Part B: implement the Scanner class to complete user input.
Modify this algorithm to look for the two pieces of parallel
information.
