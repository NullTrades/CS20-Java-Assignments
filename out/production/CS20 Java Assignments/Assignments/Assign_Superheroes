1. Create a five item ArrayList that holds the names of superheroes.

2. Print all of your Heroes ArrayList using a FOR loop.

3. Two of your superheroes have decided they want more modern and cooler names.
Using the SET function, write 2 lines of code that changes the names of only the first and last superhero to something better.  allNames.set(?, ?);

4. Use the cheat print code to reprint all of your Heroes to prove the changes worked.   System.out.println(nameOfList);


5. Set up 2 additional parallel ArrayLists that store the superpowers and an isHuman variable for the 5 characters in your original ArrayList.
Superpower ArrayList should store Strings
isHuman ArrayList should store Booleans.  Hint: ArrayList<Boolean>

6a.
Printline the following:
Name				Power			They are human?
Using a SINGLE for loop, print out all the characters so that it reads like the following.   Do not worry about getting everything to line up neatly.
Superman			Speed			false
Wonder Woman		Strength		true

6b.  Alter the above print statements so that it also prints the i value beside the superheroes.
0 Superman			Speed			false
1 Wonder Woman		Strength		true


7.  Use a filtered print to only print humans.  Reminder, ‘filtered print’ just means to use an IF statement inside your FOR loop.
Hint: 	if(isHuman.get(i)){

8.  Use a filtered print to only print those with military affiliations (name contains ‘Captain’ or name contains ‘Sergeant’, etc.)  OR some other filter you can think of.
Hint: 	if(allNames.get(i).contains(“???”)    || allNames.get(i).contains(“???”)  ) {
Above this print, add a println such as the following:
 /*********************Filtered Print - Military Heroes***********/











Advanced Challenge - Not for Marks

Your heroes have all been exposed to green glowing goo.  If they are non-human, they have lost all their powers.
Write a For Loop that:
Uses an IF statement and the isHuman ArrayList
If they are not human, it changes their superpower to “NONE”

Reprint the table (so I can compare before to after).
